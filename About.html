                        An old age home is a shelter house where the people of older age dwell together with other older people when they have been abandoned by their family members or voluntarily admitted to it to combat loneliness during this crucial stage of life. The old-age house staff is in charge of feeding these senior citizens on time and taking care of their medical needs. We help them cope with the routine by cleaning their clothes and utensils and helping them live the last days of their life without isolation.

                       We entertain them so that they become happy and jolly. Also, the house inmates stay together, share their experiences and make good bonds with their friends.
                    </p>
